Three project types are available with RStudio Cloud: Jupyter Projects, RStudio Projects, and projects from a Github repository. The ability to teach R and Python in the same cloud-based platform allows instructors to develop coding environments for students. The "new projects" button provides access to several project categories. Jupyter project support is in beta; community forums at community.rstudio.com/c/rstudio-cloud are a good place to share your thoughts.
