**Summary**

 Our  dataset's  name  is "Football teams | Rankings | Stats" taken from [Kaggle](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/football-teams-rankings-stats/>) 
 This dataset contains 10 columns and 98 observations. 2 of our variables are characteristic, 5 of them are continuous and the rest of the variables are discrete. The purpose of this project is to observe the relationship between variables and find the variables that have a big impact on the rating of the teams.
